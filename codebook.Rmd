Soooo its not that cool. Just a slightly better formatted version of summary().

What should be included in a codebook:
How the data was collected
A script detailing any processing
Information about each variable, including units, levels (of factor variables) and their meaning, specific information regarding missing data
General information about missing data, including information about how they are coded

What if I added the descriptions?
```{r}
# install.packages("memisc")
# library(memisc)
# library(lubridate)

# 
# ks %>% 
#     dplyr::select(-c(created_at, launched_at, deadline, state_changed_at)) %>% 
#     codebook()

ks$launched_at <- as.numeric(ks$launched_at)
ks$deadline <- as.numeric(ks$deadline)
ks$state_changed_at <- as.numeric(ks$state_changed_at)
ks$created_at <- as.numeric(ks$created_at)

codebook(ks)

```
